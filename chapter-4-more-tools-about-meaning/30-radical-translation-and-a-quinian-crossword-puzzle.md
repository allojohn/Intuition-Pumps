* Impossible to give a actual instance of it
* When two equally good functional interpretations clash there are no deeper facts that could settle the matter.
* The cryptographer's maxim hold:  if you can find one solution to a puzzle,you've found the only solution to the puzzle.
* Not a metapysical necessity,but just the immensely probable resulet of very powerferul constraints.
* Ther would be **no deeper facts** to settle which was "right"

## probablity game,no deeper facts

Quine's announcement is startling:

> When two equally good functional interpretations clash there are no deeper facts that could settle the matter.

For example,when two anthropologists trys to unstand the language people use where to come,it may turn out that their interpretations are different but both fit.Then,how to tell which is the right one ?Is there any more deeper facts for us to judge?Or,any metaphysical basis to deduce? The crossword puzzle dennett devise,aims at telling us that,the **reverse-engineering job,doesn't always get only one conclusion,**or to say,doesn't deduce the original appearanceï¼Œto put it even more straight,doesn't assure that what **we get is the exact essence ,no other possiblities.** Dennett uses the maxim in cryptography:if you can find one solution to a puzzle,you've found the only solution to the puzzle,**turning the reverse-engineering business into a probability game**.The reason why we can manage to reverse-engineer is that given so many constraints,we aim the search at very few targets ;and with more constrains we filter out more ,then narrow the search.By repeating such progress,candidates show up.So the reason we get the conclusion is that we **speculate on the basis of constraints ,not the essence it has**.And there is a probablity that some other theory will satisfy all the constraints,**but just too small**.
